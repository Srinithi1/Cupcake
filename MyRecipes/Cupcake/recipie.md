-  Preheat the oven to 190C, 375F, gas 5. Line two muffin trays with 12 cupcake cases or bake in batches of 12 using one muffin tray.

-  Start by creaming butter and sugar together in a bowl using a wooden spoon or electric whisk. Beat until soft and fluffy. Then add the flour, eggs, milk, and salt and whisk until the mixture is smooth.

-  Use a traditional-style ice-cream scoop, or spoon, to divide the mixture between all the paper cases making sure to get an even amount of mixture in each.

-  Place both muffin tins in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then swap over the position of the tins over and bake for a further 3-7 minutes, until both trays of cupcakes are a light golden colour.

-  Remove the tins from the oven. Leave the cupcakes to cool in the tins for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool.
